# Dissertation on dating app networks
This repository contains code for analyzing network data for use in my MSc Behavioural Science Dissertation.

For user privacy reasons, this repository does not contain the data that this code is intended to analyze.

These scripts analyze the connections and relationship in a graph of dating app users. The nodes are people and the edges are likes (directed) and matches (undirected).
